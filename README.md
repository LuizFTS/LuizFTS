# Hi, I'm Luiz!

Software Engineer focused on backend development, process automation, and building reliable systems that solve real business problems.

I have experience working with **Java and Spring Boot**, applying **OOP** and **SOLID principles** to design maintainable applications. I also work with **Angular** on the frontend and use **Git** for version control.

My background in process automation and system integration helps me approach software development with a strong focus on scalability, consistency, and real-world use cases.

Check out my pinned repositories to see projects built with Spring Boot and backend-focused solutions.
